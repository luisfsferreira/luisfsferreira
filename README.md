# Bio

👋 Hi! I'm Luís Ferreira. I completed a Bachelor's degree in Biology and Geology and earned a Master's in Bioinformatics, both from the University of Minho.

💡 My interest in biology led me to explore the potential of computing applied to biomedical research. During my Master's, I developed strong skills in **programming, data analysis, and artificial intelligence**, applying these tools to tackle real-world challenges in the healthcare field.

🧪 **Master’s Thesis:** I adapted an automatic segmentation model in **Python** to identify **fibrosis in the left ventricular myocardium** from cardiac MRI images. I implemented a new attention mechanism to improve accuracy, using techniques from **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning** with **PyTorch**.
