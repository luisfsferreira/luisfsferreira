# Bio

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm LuÃ­s Ferreira. I completed a Bachelor's degree in Biology and Geology and earned a Master's in Bioinformatics at the University of Minho.

ðŸ’¡ My interest in biology led me to explore the potential of computing applied to biomedical research. During my Master's, I developed strong skills in **programming, data analysis, and artificial intelligence**, applying these tools to tackle real-world challenges in the healthcare field.

### What I Do ðŸš€

I currently apply my skills to:

- **Develop data analysis and processing workflows** using **Python** and **R**, focusing on biological and clinical data.
- **Leverage SQL** to efficiently query, transform, and manage relational databases.
- **Build and deploy Machine Learning models** for prediction, classification, and pattern recognition.
- **Design and implement ETL pipelines** to ensure data quality, consistency, and traceability.
- **Create interactive dashboards in Power BI**, transforming complex data into actionable insights.
- **Apply statistical and exploratory data analysis techniques** to extract meaningful insights from large datasets.

ðŸ”§ **Technical Skills:**
- Languages: `Python`, `R`, `Bash`, `SQL`, `DAX`
- Frameworks & Libraries: `PyTorch`, `Scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`
- Data analysis: `Jamovi`, `Power BI`, `RStudio` 
- Databases: `MySQL`

ðŸ§  **Soft Skills**:

- Quick learner and proactive.
- Helpful and team-oriented.
- Driven by challenges and results.
- Sociable, positive, and energetic.
- Strong leadership in familiar areas.
